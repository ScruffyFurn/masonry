# Running python library unit tests

As part of the workflow solution and development container, the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/)
unit testing and [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) security testing frameworks have been
installed and configured.

## Running Tests

To run the unit and security tests, from the terminal, we use the masonry test command.

In the Terminal, from the library directory:

```bash
masonry library test
```
